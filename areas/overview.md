# Areas

There are a number of areas of the Umbraco UI that Konstrukt can be injected into, so before you get to managing your actual content you need to choose which area makes most sense to present that data in.

{% content-ref url="areas/sections.md" %}
[sections.md](areas/sections.md)

{% content-ref url="areas/dashboards.md" %}
[dashboards.md](areas/dashboards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
