# Cards

Cards provide an API to display simple summary info in a card based format and are useful for displaying key metrics about a collection.

Cards can be defined in one of two ways:

{% content-ref url="inline-cards.md" %}
[inline-cards.md](inline-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="complex-cards.md" %}
[complex-cards.md](complex-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
