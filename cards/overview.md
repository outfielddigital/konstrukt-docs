# Cards

Cards provide an API to display simple summary info in a card based format and are useful for displaying key metrics about a collection.

Cards can be defined in one of two ways:

{% content-ref url="count-cards.md" %}
[count-cards.md](count-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="custom-cards.md" %}
[custom-cards.md](custom-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
