# Cards

Cards provide an API to display simple summary info in a card based format and are useful for displaying key metrics about a collection.

Cards can be defined in one of two ways:

{% content-ref url="cards/inline-cards.md" %}
[inline-cards.md](cards/inline-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="cards/complex-cards.md" %}
[complex-cards.md](cards/complex-cards.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
